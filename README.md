# Project Template #

This project is simply my attempt to make some sort of standards (PEP) compliant boilerplate package template for a 
generic Python project.  I have pulled from multiple sources to generate this compilation.

What is included in this project:

* Basic support for Python2 and Python3.  
* Basic setup.py template with descriptions
* PyTest (pytest.ini)
* Tox (tox.ini)
* Git (.gitignore)

What is NOT included in this project:

* Pre-existing Project folder
* CI testing framework (CircleCI/Jenkins/Travis)

I have attempted to be agnostic to platforms and vendors, and yet include the best in class tools 
(or best practice tools) as I understand them.
